                                            Dave Schatzmann is the father of three, and husband of Patti for over 30 years. He has coached NOAH Volleyball, serving as the head coach of the JV team for five years. His daughters, Amy and Amanda, played for NOAH Volleyball. Amy played for Palm Beach Atlantic University for 4 years and graduated in 2018. Her team lost in the championship match of the NCAA D2 elite 8, in 2015!<br><br>
                                            It had been a vision of Dave's to offer a Christ-centered, family-friendly and affordable option of club volleyball for the NOAH Home School players, and to create a club that would be competitive in Tulsa. The dream came true, as Wave Volleyball Club was founded in 2014! Now, we exist to provide club volleyball for many, who otherwise, may not be able to even afford the "standard" club volleyball options outside of Wave.<br><br>
                                            He coached the 17 Smack team last year. Dave is a past volleyball official with the GCVOA in Tulsa, and officiated Tulsa area Junior High and High School matches.

                                            I was born and raised in Tulsa, and graduated from Union High School. I am 25, and have been playing volleyball since I was about 11-12 years old.<br><br>
                                            After Union I went on to play for a small Catholic University on a scholarship, which was in Shawnee, OK. Unfortunately this school closed down right after my senior season of volleyball, and I transferred to Oklahoma Wesleyan University for my last semester to complete my degree. I have a Bachelors in Elementary Education, and this year I am teaching 2nd grade at College Bound Academy Charter School here in East Tulsa.<br><br>
                                            This is my fourth season coaching for Wave, and last year I was the coach for 15 Smack, and the year before, 17 Smack. I have been the Head Coach for 3 years for Mingo Valley Christian School for the JV/ Varsity teams, which has enabled me to grow more as a coach. I am excited to get this new club season started with the 16 Smack team, and we will continue to pray for good health and safety this year.

I graduated from Oklahoma State in 2020 with a degree in Business Sports Management. I just moved to Tulsa in March of 2021, and currently work for Cowboy Sports Properties.<br><br>
                                            I started playing volleyball when I was 12 years old and continued to play competitively up until graduating high school. I played club volleyball through Oklahoma Charge and Rise Volleyball Club out of Oklahoma City and competed at nationals in 2014. I also played for the Oklahoma High Performance team for two years where I competed against teams from all over the world. I decided my senior year of high school not to play in college but remained involved with the sport through intramurals.<br><br>
                                            I coached the 7th grade team at Jenks this past school season, and my team won the National championship in the Frontier Conference.<br><br>
                                            As a second year head coach, I am looking foward to helping my team further advance their volleyball skill set and give back to the sport that has given me so much! I coached the 14 White team last season.

                                            My name is Peter Velet, I'm a believer and a follower of Jesus Christ! I was born and raised in a Northern part of Russia, but found my home to be, here, in the United States of America. I have lived in Tulsa area since 2001.<br><br>
                                            The Lord has blessed me with a beautiful wife Arina and a little boy, who is now four year old. His name is Girson.<br><br>
                                            Wave Volleyball Club has been my home for four years now, where the Lord has blessed me with an opportunity to share the love of the game of volleyball with others.<br><br>
                                            How did I come about a sport like volleyball? Well... I came in contact with volleyball in my early teens and, right away, I fell in love with the sport. When I started playing volleyball, I had no guidance on how to develop my skills or how to improve my performance on the court, but that didn't stop me from playing.<br><br>
                                            In my early 20s I met one of the best coaches in Tulsa area--Inna Felkins--who had a plethora of knowledge and experience in how to successfully guide and develop a player on and off the volleyball court. For the next few years I have been absorbing her knowledge of the game like a sponge, as I coached along her side, at Green County Volleyball Club and Tulsa Volleyball Academy. Over the years, the importance of proper technique and body mechanics of volleyball were embedded in me and are now a significant part of my coaching of the game.<br><br>
                                            I'm looking forward to sharing my knowledge and experience, as well as to continue my own journey of learning. Because, if one is not learning, he/she is not improving!

                                            My name is Deanna Bloomer. I have been coaching for many years. My coaching career began when my daughters were young and wanted to cheer for their older brother who played little league football. Though I did not know much about cheer, I wanted to be able to spend time with my daughters and see my boys on the field at the same time. As much as I enjoyed coaching these young ladies in cheer, my dream was to coach volleyball. My volleyball coaching career started in Colorado as head coach of a 9th grade team and assistant of the JV and Varsity teams. I moved to Oklahoma in June 2019 and was offered a coaching position at Jenks Middle School where my 8-2's team won 1st in the Nationals Frontier Conference finals my first year there. I continued to coach for Jenks for several more years after that.

                                            This will be my 3rd season with Wave Volleyball Club. My first year, I was the 15-White coach, and our team took 3rd place in the Club Division at Regionals. Last season I coached 16 Smack and this year I will be coaching the 14-White and 17 Smack teams.<br><br>
                                            I was born and raised in San Diego where I played volleyball in high school. Also, I spent a lot of time playing beach volleyball and watching matches along the coastline of Southern California. After high school I moved on to play volleyball at Southwestern Baptist College in Arizona.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Just as I have love for volleyball, my daughters have found that same love for the game. In my spare time I also enjoy watching them play volleyball or playing with them any time I have the opportunity.
                                            <br><br>
                                            I am looking forward to a wonderful season. I am excited to get to know these young ladies. I am looking forward to watching each of these players grow in their own way and see how I can grow as a coach, as there is always room for growth personally, skillfully, and spiritually.

                                            I have played volleyball since I was 9-10 years old, starting in the catholic school league. I immediately knew the volleyball court was my second home and jumped into Club playing for a few organizations throughout Tulsa, attending nationals multiple times. My senior year I had to make the hard decision to step away from volleyball after suffering multiple breaks in my foot. In college, intramurals gave me the opportunity to remain involved in the game.

                                            My volleyball career started the summer after my eighth-grade year as I attended clinics at our local high school. Though I would practice and run some drills with my mom as she coached her 9th grade team, this was my first true experience with the sport.
                                            <br><br>
                                            We lived in Colorado at the time and Colorado schools did not have competitive middle school sports. When I moved to Tulsa my freshman year, I was a tad bit behind. I decided right away that I was going to work hard and nonstop to learn and improve my game. Any chance I had, I went to open clinics and practices with our school team, and learned one on one with any coach that would take the time to teach me.
                                            <br><br>
                                            I have now been playing for a little over 3 years and I continue to grow and learn and take in all I can of volleyball. My mom jokes that I eat, sleep, breathe volleyball.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Next school year I will go off to college and I already have a few college offers to play volleyball. My parents and I have not quite decided on which direction we are going to take, but I am excited to see what God has in store for me with volleyball. God has blessed me in this sport, allowing me to meet many friends and growing as a player and person.
                                            <br><br>
                                            This will be my first season as a practice coach with Wave and I am so excited to be able to encourage and help these young ladies grow in the game that I love so much.

                                            I moved to Tulsa just over 3 years ago and grew up in Stillwater, OK and attended Oklahoma State University where I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelors in Child Family Services. I now works for the Oklahoma Department of Human Services and specifically in the Foster Care and Adoptions Unit.
                                            <br><br>
                                            I playing volleyball when I was 12 years old and played all through school and my club journey was through Stillwater Volleyball Club. I was involved in intramurals at OSU and continued to play recreationally. I have a good work ethic and also love to encourage others to be their best.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Now in my third year as a Wave Coach, I'm excited for this upcoming season and for the opportunity to be a mentor and to instil values of integrity, teamwork and good sportsmanship. I'm looking forward to helping players improve on their volleyball skills while also keeping Christ in the center.

                                            She started coaching volleyball while teaching for Tulsa Public Schools, then onto coaching at Bixby, and a few seasons of club for a couple of local clubs.
