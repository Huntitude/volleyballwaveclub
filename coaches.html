                                <p class="bio">Wave Volleyball Club has been my home since 2018, where the Lord has blessed me with an opportunity to share the love and passion for the game with others. At the start of 2023-2024 season, I have assumed a Co-Club Director role alongside Deanna Bloomer, who is handling many of the Administrative functions of the club, while I am performing numerous of the Operations functions at Wave.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Now a bit about myself. My name is Peter Velet, I'm a believer and a follower of Jesus Christ! I was born and raised in a Northern part of Russia, but found my home to be, here, in the United States of America. I have lived in Tulsa since 2001. The Lord has blessed me with a beautiful wife, Arina, and a son, Girson, who is now six.
                                    <br><br>
                                    How did I come about a sport like volleyball? Well... I came in contact with volleyball in my early teens. Right away, I fell in love with the sport. When I started playing volleyball, I had no guidance on how to develop my skills or how to improve my performance on the court, but that didn't stop me from playing.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In my early 20s I had the opportunity and the honor to work alongside of one of the best coaches in Tulsa area—Inna Felkins—who had a plethora of knowledge and experience in how to successfully guide and develop a player on and off the volleyball court. For the next several years, I have been absorbing her knowledge of the game like a sponge, as I coached alongside her, at Green County Volleyball Club and Tulsa Volleyball Academy. Over the years, the importance of proper technique and body mechanics of volleyball were embedded in me and are now a significant part of my coaching of the game.
                                    
                                    I'm looking forward to sharing my knowledge and experience, as well as to continue my own journey of learning. Because, if one is not learning, he/she is not improving! </p>

                                    My volleyball career started the summer after my eighth-grade year as I attended clinics at our local high school. Though I would practice and run some drills with my mom as she coached her 9th grade team, this was my first true experience with the sport.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    We lived in Colorado at the time and Colorado schools did not have competitive middle school sports. When I moved to Tulsa my freshman year, I was a tad bit behind. I decided right away that I was going to work hard and nonstop to learn and improve my game. Any chance I had, I went to open clinics, and practices with our school team, and learned one on one with any coach that would take the time to teach me.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    I have now been playing for a little over 4 years and I continue to grow and learn and take in all I can of volleyball. My mom jokes that I eat, sleep, breathe volleyball.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    I received a scholarship offer to play at the collegiate level and I am excited to see what God has instore for me with volleyball. God has blessed me in this sport, meeting many friends, and growing as a player and person.
                                    This will be my second season with Wave. I will be the head coach for the 14 Tsunami. Last season I was a Head Coach for 13 Tsunami. I am so excited to be able to encourage and help these young ladies grow in the game that I love so much.

                                    My name is Deanna Bloomer. My coaching career started when my daughters were young and wanted to cheer for their older brother who played little league football. Though I did not know much about cheer, I wanted to be able to spend time with my daughters and see my boys on the field at the same time. I studied and learned as much as I could to help these little ones along in the sport. As much as I enjoyed coaching these young ladies in cheer, my dream was to coach volleyball. My volleyball coaching career started in Colorado as head coach of a 9th grade team and assistant of the JV and Varsity teams. I moved to Oklahoma in June 2019 and was offered a coaching position at Jenks Middle School where my 8-2's team won 1st in the Nationals Frontier Conference finals my first year there. I continued to coach for Jenks for several more years after that.

                                    This will be my 5th season with Wave Volleyball. My first year, I was the 15 White coach, and our team took 3rd place in the Club Division at Regionals. Last season I coached 15 Tide and Practice Coach for 13 Tsunami. In the 23-24 season, I became Co-director alongside Peter Velet. It has been an honor to work with him and seeing how God is working in our Club, coaches, and players that help make this club successful.

                                    I was born and raised in San Diego where I played volleyball in high school. Also, I spent a lot of time playing beach volleyball and watching matches along the coastline of Southern California. After high school I moved on to play volleyball at Southwestern Baptist College in Arizona.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Just as I have love for volleyball, my daughters have found that same love for the game. In my spare time I also enjoy watching them play volleyball or playing with them any time I have the opportunity. When I am not doing volleyball, I enjoy teaching Awana's at church and being involved in other various services with my church serving the Lord.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I am looking forward to a wonderful season. I am excited to get to know these young ladies. I am looking forward to watching each of these players grow in their own way and see how I can grow as there is always room for growth personally skillfully and spiritually.

                                    I have played volleyball since I was 9-10 years old, starting in the catholic school league. I immediately knew the volleyball court was my second home and jumped into Club playing for a few organizations throughout Tulsa, attending nationals multiple times. My senior year I had to make the hard decision to step away from volleyball after suffering multiple breaks in my foot. In college, intramurals gave me the opportunity to remain involved in the game.
